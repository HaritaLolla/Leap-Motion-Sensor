# Leap Motion Sensor
 
 Leap Motion is an optical sensor that consists of 2 IR camera's and 3 IR LED emitters. This device is used detect hand gestures and fingers positionâ€™s with 
 sub-millimetre accuracy.
 
 In this project I have written a python code for communicating with the Leap Motion controller. The output of this implementation will be the raw data recieved 
 from the controller. This data can be very useful for further ananlysis or development. 

The following hardware is need to fetch the data:
1.	Leap Motion controller

The following softwares are need to run the code:
1.	Leap SDK
2.	Orion (Software Version: 3.2.1+45911)
3.	Python 2.7 compiler

Note that leap motion currently does not support python 3.
